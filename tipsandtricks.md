# Tips and Tricks
Realization and study habits I used through the course. 

* Watch video tutorials 2x speed or more.
* Read the lecture ahead and do the exercises (or labs) before the scheduled lecture.
* Whatever you do, take a break every 60 mins or every 90 mins at most.
* Learn from multiple sources on your own. Its good to see other's perspective.
