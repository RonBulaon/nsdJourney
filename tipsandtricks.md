## Tips and Tricks
* Watch video lectures/tutorials 2x speed or more.
* Read the lecture ahead and do the exercises (or labs) before the scheduled lecture.
* Whatever you do, take a break every 60 mins or every 90 mins at most.
* Learn from multiple sources on your own. Its good to see other's perspective.
* Build your own **Cheat Sheet**
* Be very good at note taking.
* Exchange notes with others to seee what you've missed.
* Bullet journaling helps on my planning and scheduling.
* Since Packet Tracer is a network simulation only, use **autotyper** applications to do repetive stuff in Packet Tracer.

## Module Take Away
### **CCNA 1/2/3** - (Week 1 to 11)
  * I'm not new to networking, but its my first time learning how to configure Cisco devices. I learned a lot in **configuring cisco devices via CLI** and raised my confidence level from intermediate to advance (maybe higher) networking. 
  * The case studies, labs and final assesments are all very helpful. It all gave me a good review on networking and gained new perspective in modern day implementation.
