Realizations and study habits I used through the course.

* Read the lecture ahead and do the exercises (or labs) before the scheduled lecture.
* Whatever you do, take a break every 60 mins or every 90 mins at most.
* Learn from multiple sources on your own. Its good to see other's perspective.
* Build your own **Cheat Sheet**
* Be very good at note taking.
* Exchange notes with other to seee what you've missed.
* Bullet journaling helps on my planning and scheduling.
