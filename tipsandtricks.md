## Tips and Tricks
* Watch video lectures/tutorials 2x speed or more.
* Read the lecture ahead and do the exercises (or labs) before the scheduled lecture.
* Whatever you do, take a break every 60 mins or every 90 mins at most.
* Learn from multiple sources on your own. Its good to see other's perspective.
* Build your own **Cheat Sheet**
* Be very good at note taking.
* Exchange notes with others to seee what you've missed.
* Bullet journaling helps on my planning and scheduling.
* Since Packet Tracer is a network simulation only, use **autotyper** applications to do repetitive stuff in Packet Tracer.

## Module Take Away
### **CCNA 1/2/3** - (Week 1 to 11)
  * I'm not new to networking, but its my first time learning to configure Cisco devices. I learned a lot in **configuring cisco devices via CLI** and raised my confidence level from intermediate to advance (maybe higher) networking. 
  * The case studies, labs and final assesments are all very helpful. It all gave me a good review on networking and gained new perspective in modern day implementation. 
  
### **Python** - (Week 12 to 13)
  * I have good back ground in programing and somehow this module's Network programability is enough to provoke some thoughts.
  * They teach enough just to get by and explore on your own for pytho usage on network programability.
  * Low light : Whatever theyt taught was mentioned for class only not really used in real networking.

### Cisco CyberOps - (Week 14 to 17)
  * More like exploration of Windows and Linux. Very little on advance topics.
  * Highlight : Lab works on Securityy Onion are nice. I never used those tools before except for Wireshark so its a good take a way for me to learn new tools.
  * Lowlight : Course profile looks like for SOC operations but it alsmost don't have SIEM topics that can be usable for live operation of SOC.

### Palo Alto Networks - (Week 17 to 18)
  * On going
