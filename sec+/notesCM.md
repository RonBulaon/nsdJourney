### Assisted Lab 08: Managing Certificates with OpenSSL (linux)
#### Use basic OpenSSL commands
* Check OpenSSL version
  ```bash
  # openssl version
  ```
* Generate an asymmetric encryption RSA key pair and extract the public portion to prepare to create a certificate signing request.
  ```bash
  # mkdir keys
  # cd keys
  # openssl genrsa -out corp.515support.com.key 2048
  # cat corp.515support.com.key
  ```
* Extract the public key file to a file for export with a CSR.
  ```bash
  # openssl rsa -in corp.515support.com.key -pubout -out corp.515support.com_public.key
  # cat corp.515support.com_public.key
  ```

#### Generate a certificate signing request
* Generate a certificate signing request.
  ```bash
  # openssl req -new -key corp.515support.com.key -out corp.515support.com.csr
  ```
* Verify the certificate request.
  ```bash
  # openssl req -text -in corp.515support.com.csr -noout -verify
  ```
* The certificate signing request must be sent to the certificate authority using the PEM format. Run the following command to display the CSR file in this format:
  ```bash
  # cat corp.515support.com.csr
  ```

#### Convert certificate format
* Generate a self-signed certificate
  ```bash
  # openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout corp.515support.com.key -x509 -days 365 -out corp.515support.com.crt
  ```

#### Merge the .key and .crt files (the non-Windows PEM format) into a .pfx file (the Windows PKCS#12 format)
* Convert the files
  ```bash
  # openssl pkcs12 -export -name "corp.515support.com" -out corp.515support.com.pfx -inkey corp.515support.com.key -in corp.515support.com.crt
  ```

        ```
   4. Restart the rsyslog service
        ```bash
        # systemctl restart rsyslog
        ```
    5. Test logging
        ```bash
        # logger "Test from Kali"
        ```
        * From local the log should reflect on ```/var/log/messages```.
          ```bash
          # cat /var/log/messages | grep -i test
          ```
        * From remote server (10.1.0.10) log should reflect on ```KALI.log```
          ```bash
          # cat /var/log/KALI.log | grep -i "test"
          ```

#### Backup files on Linux
  1. Create a directory and several files
     ```bash
     # mkdir /inventory
     # touch /inventory/hardware.txt /inventory/software.txt
     # ls /inventory
     ```
  2. Create a backup job named inventory.tar
     ```bash
     # cd /inventory
     # tar -cf inventory.tar /inventory
     # tar -tf inventory.tar
     ```
  3.  Append the new devices.txt file to the existing inventory.tar tarball
     ```bash
     # touch /inventory/devices.txt
     # tar -rf inventory.tar /inventory/devices.txt
     ```
  4. Generate a hash of the inventory.tar backup job
     ```bash
     # md5sum inventory > /root/backuphash
     ```
  5. Copy the backup job to the LX1 VM by using scp
     ```bash
     # scp inventory.tar root@10.1.0.10:/root/inventory.tar
