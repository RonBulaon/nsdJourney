# My NSD Journey

Information here are my schedules, notes, exercises, etc., while I'm taking *Network Security Diploma at University of Winnipeg*. I wrote it down here for future referece and as a way for me to relook at the jouney after. I started February 2022 and all other information here are all in progress.

Forgive me if I have not considered you as a reader. Unlike my other works here in github, these notes are writen down as I study (either in lecture, or at most from my self study in late evenings), thus my priority here is to acquire knowledge and sharing comes second.
